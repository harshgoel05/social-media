- Superset of Javascript

Pages:
1. / - Homepage!
2. /event - Displays event (static data as no info mentioned)
3. /create - Form with all required fields, didn't knew/wasn't mentioned which fields so took according to design


It was mentioned bonus points for editing event info but we are not storing it anywhere (no details mentioned) so made it static, can do it dyanmic tho but would need APIs or localstorage so yeah, didn't get what to do here.
